## 🎯 Objectives
- Create a currency converter

## ✔️ Specifications
### 🌱 Must-haves
- Pick a travel destination and check the exchange rate
- Make a small webpage where you can enter the local rate, which is converted to the price in € (No need to get updated rates from external APIs).
- Use a form that submits to PHP (no JS allowed / no preventDefault)


### 🌻 Nice-to-haves
- Allow the user to choose between different currencies
- Provide a button to switch the from / to valuta types (So Euro -> Dollar becomes Dollar --> Euro)
